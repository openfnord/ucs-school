# UCS@school

Welcome to the git mirror of UCS@school.
[UCS@school](https://www.univention.com/products/ucsschool/) is a
comprehensive solution to provide access to infrastructure and
applications in schools as well as a complete toolset to operate them.
It can be used in an individual school but it is best suited for school
districts or school authorities centrally managing infrastructure for
tens or hundreds of schools. It is used by a number of larger school
authorities in Germany.
