General notes on the update
===========================

During the update, services within the domain may fail. For this reason, the
update should be performed within a maintenance window. It is generally
recommended to install and test the update in a test environment first. The test
environment should be identical to the production environment.

Update process
==============

Major updates for |UCSUAS| are released in the Univention App Center as a
standalone app update. Minor updates and bug fixes (errata for |UCSUAS|) that do
not require interaction with the administrator are released in the repository of
the already released app version of |UCSUAS|. The changelog documents that
Univention issues with each |UCSUAS| app version are then expanded accordingly
with a new section that shows which packages were released at what time and
which errors were fixed in the process.
