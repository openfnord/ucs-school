**NOTE:** If you are a new developer doing the release for the first time,
you should also follow the [First Time Preparation](README_manual_release.md#first-time-preparations)
section in the manual release documentation.

## Prepare a VM for testing

If you don't have one already, create a [UCS@school multi-server env](https://jenkins2022.knut.univention.de/view/UCS@school/job/UCSschool-5.0/view/Environments/job/SchoolMultiserverEnvironment/) to use for testing when [doing QA](README_qa_for_release.md).

## Prerequisites

### Check packages for readiness

Before starting the release, [check packages for readiness](README_check_release_packages.md).

## Update Test AppCenter

### General updates

Follow the instructions for [manual release to Test AppCenter](README_manual_release.md#push-changes-to-test-appcenter).
Keep in mind:

* You will need the list of YAML files you edited in the [previous verification steps](README_check_release_packages.md#verify-yaml-advisories).
* You should make a note of the packages that get uploaded from the `copy_app_binaries` command.

## Publish to production App Center

The following code can be executed on `omar`.

The correct version string, for example `ucsschool_20230802094418`, can be found in the [Test AppCenter](https://appcenter-test.software-univention.de/meta-inf/5.0/ucsschool/) by navigating to the last (published) version.

```shell
cd /mnt/omar/vmwares/mirror/appcenter
./copy_from_appcenter.test.sh 5.0 ucsschool_20230802094418  # copies the given version to public app center on local mirror!
sudo update_mirror.sh -v appcenter  # syncs the local mirror to the public download server!
```

## Update Changelog

### Move the advisories to published

You will need the list of YAML files you edited in the [Verify YAML Advisories](README_check_release_packages.md#verify-yaml-advisories) step.

In your local `ucsschool` repository, move the YAML advisories into the `doc/errata/published` folder, renamed with the current date:

```shell
cd doc/errata/staging
release_files=( "ucs-school-lib.yaml" "ucs-school-umc-users.yaml" )
for file in "${release_files[@]}"; do git mv "$file" "$(echo $file | sed "s/^/..\/published\/$(date +%Y-%m-%d)-/")"; done
```

Commit the changes to git, and `cd` to the root of the `ucsschool` repository.

### Generate the changelog

Open up a second terminal for running docker commands.
Then follow the instructions in the [changelog README](../ucsschool-changelog/README.md).

## Publish UCS@school manual

The documentation is built by a [gitlab pipeline](https://git.knut.univention.de/univention/docs.univention.de/-/pipelines)
that is triggered by a merge from `ucsschool`.
Follow the steps cf. the Build the documentation steps in [ucsschool-changelog](../ucsschool-changelog/README.md).
Follow the pipeline to be sure it completes correctly, and then check the
[published documentation](http://univention-repository.knut.univention.de/download/docs/).

## Update public information

### Update the release announcement wiki

Update [Release Ankündigungen für UCS@school 5.0](https://help.univention.com/t/release-ankundigungen-fur-ucs-school-5-0-stand-17-11-2022/20184)
by adding a new section below the existing ones and updating the change date in
the headline.
