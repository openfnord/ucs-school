# GitLab usage conventions

## Merge Requests

### Threads

Only the creator of the thread can close it unless it is a direct patch.
If the direct patch is applied, GitLab automatically resolves the thread.

Any other behavior other than this should be requested by the thread opener.
An example can be: Someone who proposes a patch, requests the MR assignee to
reopen the thread after the patch is automatically applied by GitLab.
