desc: |
  * When performing a user import with an email in the scheme, a maildomain is required in the JSON config or in the UCRV <envar>mail/hosteddomains</envar>. This fix ensures, that the import only is performed when these requirements are met. Otherwise, an error will be raised (Bug #48243).
  * Having syntax errors in the configuration lead to unhelpful and unclear tracebacks. This fix shortens the error message to the important information (Bug #49578).
