 * Passwords for new users are now better readable.
   They do not contain characters that are difficult to distinguish (like 'I' and 'l' or 'O' and '0') anymore.
   The number of special characters has been limited to below 20% of the password length and passwords always start with a letter.
   The Microsoft requirement that passwords contain characters from at least three character classes is met (Bug #45640).
 * A potential bug when creating new school OUs has been fixed (Bug #46194).
 * The listing of user objects is not prevented anymore, if a malformed object exists (Bug #46130).
