 * By default, the password of the computer account is changed every 21 days. This has caused the ucs-school-user-logonscript-daemon to stop working from the time of the change. The daemon is now restarted automatically during the password change (Bug #47805).
 * Desktop shortcuts were created by the UCS@school netlogon scripts only if they did not already exist on the desktop. If UCR variables were modified for the desktop shortcuts, the next time the user logged in, the shortcut was not updated automatically. This problem is now fixed when the netlogon scripts of the users are rebuilt (automatically or manually via <command>univention-directory-listener-ctrl resync ucs-school-user-logonscript</command> (Bug #47937).
