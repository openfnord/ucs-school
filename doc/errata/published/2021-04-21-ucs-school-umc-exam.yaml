  * In some situations exam-users could not access their home directories after starting the same exam twice in a short time interval in a multi-server environment. This patch fixes this issue (Bug #52680).
  * Internal improvement: The code of the hooks which runs after the creation of OUs, was migrated to the package <package>ucs-school-lib</package> (Bug #52853).
