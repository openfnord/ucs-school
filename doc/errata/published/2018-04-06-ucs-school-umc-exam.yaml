 * When uploading files with Internet Explorer, the files were not always correctly saved in the local
   file system by the UMC module <guimenu>Start Exam</guimenu> and were therefore not distributed to the users. This error
   has now been corrected. (Bug #46710).
 * The new UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/exam/user/homedir/autoremove</envar> has been added to control
   whether the exam users' home directories are automatically deleted after the exam mode has ended.
   By default (<literal>yes</literal>), the directories are removed after collecting the exam results (Bug #46719).
