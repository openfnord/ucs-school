 * The tracking of exam users has been improved: in the past, problems could occur if users participated in several parallel tests and one of the tests was finished. The membership in exams is no longer recorded in LDAP via the attribute <literal>ucsschoolSchool</literal> but via an additional role entry in <literal>ucsschoolRole</literal> (Bug # 50819).
 * The containers for exam users are now cached per OU. This fixes problems with exam users from multiple OUs (Bug #50588).
