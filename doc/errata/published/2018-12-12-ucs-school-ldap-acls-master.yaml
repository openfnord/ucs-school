desc: |
 * Insufficient LDAP permissions and an typo within the LDAP ACLs prevented teachers from resetting student
   passwords if the student is located underneath another school OU. The problem also occurred when a school
   administrator tried to reset a teacher password. Both problems have been fixed (Bug #47625).
 * Added new beta feature to enable educational school slaves to replicate also UCS@school staff user objects.
   This feature can be activated via the UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/ldap/replicate_staff_to_edu</envar>.
   Please activate this feature only if you know all side effects and necessary steps (Bug #48068).
