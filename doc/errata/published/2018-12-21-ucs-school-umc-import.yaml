desc: |
 * If external SSL certificates (from e.g. let's encrypt) are used on the domaincontroller master and master's FQDN
   differs from the FQDNs within the SSL certificate, the UMC module "Benutzerimport" threw a traceback. The new
   UCR variables <envar>ucsschool/import/http_api/client/server</envar> and <envar>ucsschool/import/http_api/client/ssl_verify</envar>
   now allow to specify the correct FQDN used in the SSL certificates resp. to disable SSL checks at all (the latter one is NOT recommended!) (Bug #47911).
