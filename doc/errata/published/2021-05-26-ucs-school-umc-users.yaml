desc: |
 * Importing model classes from the Python package <code>ucsschool.lib.models</code> has been deprecated for UCS@school 5.0. The packages <code>__init__.py</code> file does not import all classes from its submodules anymore. From UCS@school 5.0 on, the classes must be imported directly. For example <code>from ucsschool.lib.models import Student</code> must now be written as <code>from ucsschool.lib.models.user import Student</code>. This patch updates the code in 4.4, so it will run unchanged in 5.0  (Bug #52945).
