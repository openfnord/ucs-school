  * Some birthday date formats could not be parsed correctly during an user import (e.g. dd.mm.yy). This fix adds various common formats that will be accepted. (Bug #48138)
  * A user import crashed when a class name contained unallowed characters (e.g. a backslash). This fix ensures, that such characters will be replaced with a configurable replacement character. (Bug #45683)
