 * The SiSoPI documentation has been moved from the packages HTML documentation to the official UMC-import manual: https://docs.software-univention.de/ucsschool-umc-import-handbuch-4.4.html (Bug #50806).
 * The script <filename>ucs-school-purge-expired-users</filename> does not fail anymore in a scenario where <literal>school</literal> is not set in the import configuration (e.g. SiSoPI) (Bug #50406).
