desc: |
 * The creation of exam students will no longer copy specific operational LDAP attributes from the original user. In effect the LDAP attribute blacklist stored in the UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/exam/user/ldap/blacklist</envar> is implicitly extended by a hardcoded set of operational attribute names. This change is required for compatibility with UCS 5.0-2 where operational LDAP attributes are added to the internal user information of UDM (Bug #54896).
 * The directory name validation now detects all incorrect names. Additionally, the exam directory name description has been improved (Bug #52719).
