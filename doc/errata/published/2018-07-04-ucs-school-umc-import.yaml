 * Buttons to return to the modules overview page have been added to the dry run result page and the error page (Bug #46795).
 * The user roles drop-down item displayed a static list of user roles that also contained unavailable roles.
   The drop-down item now dynamically obtains a list of available user roles from the server (Bug #45749).
