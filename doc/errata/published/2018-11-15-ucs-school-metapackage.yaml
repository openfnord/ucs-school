 * When UCS@school is first installed, a demo school with a demo portal is now automatically created. On existing
   UCS@school environments that are now being updated, the demo school will not be created. To prevent the demo school
   from being created automatically, the UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/join/create_demo</envar> must be set to <literal>no</literal>
   before installation (Bug #47807).
