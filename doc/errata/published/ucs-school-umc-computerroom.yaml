desc: |
 * Internal improvement: separate UMC and non-UMC code in schoolldap module (Bug #47418).
 * When exiting the class work mode, a reboot of Windows computers is no longer mandatory, depending on the configuration.
   Therefore, the UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/exam/default/show/restart</envar> is now evaluated when exiting the
   class work mode and the corresponding dialog is only displayed if required (Bug #49961).
