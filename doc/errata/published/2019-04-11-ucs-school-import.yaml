desc: |
 * Additional special characters in usernames can now be configured by the new configuration key <literal>username:allowed_special_chars</literal>. The default value is backwards compatible with previous UCS@school versions and contains only the dot. Besides the dot, only dash and underscore can also be used (resulting in the configuration value ".-_") (Bug #49259).
 * Internal improvement: the PyHook loading code was consolidated (Bug #49268).
 * A hook was added that allows to modify the configuration after reading the configuration files and applying the command line arguments. The base class is <classname>ucsschool.importer.utils.config_pyhook.ConfigPyHook</classname> (Bug #49264).
 * A hook was implemented that manipulates the configuration depending on the imported user role (Bug #49266).
