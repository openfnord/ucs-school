   the local maschine. The link to the Univention Portal may be altered via UCR variable
   <envar>ucsschool/userlogon/portallink/link</envar> (unset by default). Please note that a user's netlogon script
   is only automatically updated when their group memberships change. To update the netlogon scripts of all users,

   executed (Bug #46922).
