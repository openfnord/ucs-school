  * When creating a new school via the UMC, the name length of the new school server is automatically checked. The allowed maximum length was raised from 12 to 13 characters (Bug #51274).
  * It is now possible to create SchoolAdmins via the user wizard. It is disabled by default with the UCRV <envar>ucsschool/wizards/schoolwizards/users/roles/disabled</envar> (Bug #52748).
