 * Class shares, Workgroup shares, and Marketplace shares are created in such a way that students can no longer change folder permissions or take ownership. Teachers assigned to the class and OU-admins can still change permissions and take ownership. The permissions are added to the Windows NT ACLs, which are set on the shares root folder (Bug #42182).
 * The Workgroup class now maps email related group properties (Bug #52035).
