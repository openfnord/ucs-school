 * Class Shares, Workgroup Shares, and Marketplace Shares are created in such a way that students can no longer change folder permissions or take ownership. Teachers assigned to the class and OU-admins still can change permissions and take ownership. The permissions are added to the Windows NT ACLs, which set in the share folder (Bug #42182).
