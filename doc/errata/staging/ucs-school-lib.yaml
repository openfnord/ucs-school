desc: |
  * Allow to disable the logging of validation errors upon validation of UCS@school objects: use the UCR variable <envar>validation/logging/enabled</envar> to control this (Bug #52884).
  * Code for checking the consistency of UCS@school objects has been added (Bug #52147).
  * Internal improvement: An error was fixed, which was raised when the UCS@school validation was executed by other users than root (Bug #52883).
  * Internal improvement: The code used for the UCS@school validation now honours custom group prefixes, which are set by the UCR variables <envar>ucsschool/ldap/default/groupprefix/*</envar> (Bug #52880).
