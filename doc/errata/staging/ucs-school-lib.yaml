desc: |
 * Internal: Add `check_name` parameter to the `validate` method of multiple classes which allows disabling name checks such as checking if a user with the same user name already exists in another school (Bug #55016).
 * Underscores are now allowed in OU names, when the hostname of the school server is also passed (Bug #55125).
