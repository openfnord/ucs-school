 * The number of exam backup files is now limited and is compressed into a zip archive by default (Bug #49333).
 * The home directories of exam accounts are now kept by default and are not deleted anymore. Also the UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/exam/user/homedir/autoremove</envar> is unset once upon updating to restore the default behavior. To restore the previous behavior, you have to set the UCR variable back to <literal>yes</literal> again (Bug #49443).
 * Internal improvement: a list of exams can now be retrieved via a UMC call (Bug #49519).
 * Internal improvement: a list of students in a school class or work group can now be retrieved via a UMC call (Bug #49525).
