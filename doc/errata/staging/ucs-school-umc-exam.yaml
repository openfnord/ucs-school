desc: |
 * The number of exam backup files is now limited and is compressed into a zip archive by default (Bug #49333).
 * The home folders of exam accounts are now kept by default and are not deleted anymore. Also <envar>ucsschool/exam/user/homedir/autoremove</envar> is unset once upon updating to restore the default behavior. To restore the previous behavior you have to set the variable to <literal>yes</literal> again (Bug #49443).
