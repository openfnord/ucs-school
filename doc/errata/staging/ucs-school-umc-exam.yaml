 * During an exam the exam folder in the exam user's home directory cannot be removed or renamed anymore.
   This change prevents problems while collecting the exam results if the exam folder has been accidentally
   renamed, moved or deleted (Bug #49953).
 * Previously, the logon restriction of users during an exam had to be implemented using computer-related GPOs.
   Starting with this release, when an exam is started, the user object of both the exam user
   and the original user is automatically adjusted to restrict the logon of these users.
   The exam user may only log on to the Windows computers of the room in which the exam is written.
   For the corresponding original user, the login on all Windows systems of the domain is locked during the exam.
   This logon restriction only affects the Windows computers of the UCS@school domain. Similar to the previous GPO
   policy, it does not affect external services or non-Windows systems (Bug #49960).
 * The above-mentioned change to the logon restrictions  eliminates in most cases the need for computer-related GPOs.
   For new installations of UCS@school, the reboot for Windows computers is no longer offered/forced when starting an
   exam. The step is then skipped when starting a test. On existing UCS@school installations, the UCR variable
   <envar>ucsschool/exam/default/show/restart</envar> is automatically set to <literal>yes</literal> to retain the old behavior.
   Therefore, when reinstalling a UCS@school system or adding additional school servers, make sure that the UCR
   variable is set appropriately on all systems (Bug #49961).
 * A proper error message is now shown, when trying to create an exam with a name that is already in use (Bug #49902).
 * Internal improvement: separate UMC and non-UMC code in schoolldap module (Bug #47418).
