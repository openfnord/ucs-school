 * When starting an exam, users often overlooked selecting the correct room so
   that the exam was started for the wrong computer/room. The selection field
   for the room in the exam wizard is now empty and the user must explicitly
   select a room, to prevent the described issue (Bug #45730).
 * The description text for the file share restriction options in exam wizard has been renamed to improve usability (Bug #43037).
