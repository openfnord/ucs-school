 * If the creation of an exam failed, user accounts could be left in a state, where they cannot log into Windows workstation. (Technically: the value of <envar>sambaUserWorkstations</envar> of the original user remained with a prepended dollar sign.) The script <command>exam-and-room-cleanup</command>, now also restores the users original values, allowing them to log into Windows machines. (Bug #50636).
