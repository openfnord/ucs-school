desc: |
  * When having the OX App Suite installed on a UCS@School System, the package <package>ucs-school-ox-support</package> is required to be installed. This fix implements a new diagnostic module which checks, if the package is correctly installed. (Bug #52195).
  * A diagnostic module now checks if the UCS@school Veyon Proxy app has been installed on single server and school server systems (Bug #52463).
  * A CLI script (<filename>/usr/share/ucs-school-umc-diagnostic/scripts/ucs-school-object-consistency</filename>) and the diagnostic module "UCS@school Consistency Check" to check the consistency of all LDAP objects on a UCS@School system was added. This can help identifying many problems related to users, groups, shares or containers (Bug #52147).
  * The diagnostic module "UCS@school Check if Samba4 is installed" ran on systems which are not required to have Samba4 installed. This fix ensures, that it only is executed in single-server-environments or on school servers in multi-server-environments (Bug #51886).
