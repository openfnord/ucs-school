desc: |
  * The python-support debhelper has been removed from the package <package>ucs-school-umc-diagnostic</package> (Bug #53386).
  * The UCS@school object consistency script parametrization did not behave intuitively in certain cases. This fix resolves those issues (Bug #53211).
  * The diagnostic check <envar>UCS@school Check admin accounts</envar> gave misleading output when an admin was missing in a school's admin group. This fix improves the output messages and additionally adds a check, which ensures that an admin is not in a wrong admin group (Bug #53139).
