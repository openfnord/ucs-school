 * In UCS we can switch backends for DNS by UCRV dns/backend from samba4 to ldap. This variable must be set to "samba4" in UCS@school systems with the role dc master, dc slave and dc backup. This fix adds a diagnostic module which checks if the UCRV of dns/backend is set correctly (Bug #50503).
 * Users that are considered for user-imports, might have a sourceUID but no recordUID set. However, this will most likely lead to problems in the future and should be avoided. This fix adds a diagnostic module which detects users with a sourceUID but no recordUID set (Bug #51542).
