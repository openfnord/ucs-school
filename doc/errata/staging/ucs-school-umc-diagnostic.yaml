desc: |
 * Republish code of version 1.0.0-11A: In UCS we can switch backends for DNS by UCRV dns/backend from samba4 to ldap. This variable must be set to samba4 in UCS@school systems with the role dc master, dc slave and dc backup. This fix adds a diagnostic module which checks if the UCRV of dns/backend is set correctly (Bug #50503).
 * Republish code of version 1.0.0-11A: Users that are considered for user-imports, might have a sourceUID but no recordUID set. However, this will most likely lead to problems in the future and should be avoided. This fix adds a diagnostic module which detects users with a sourceUID but no recordUID set (Bug #51542).
 * Users that are considered for user-imports, must have a unique sourceUID-recordUID combination. This fix adds a diagnostic module, which checks that those combinations do not have any duplicates. (Bug #51494).
