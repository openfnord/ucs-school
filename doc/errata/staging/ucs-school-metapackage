 * On servers with the role of DC master in single server environments or DC slaves, the script set_nt_acl_on_shares is executed during the joinscript. Permissions are set so that students can no longer change folder permissions or take over class, workgroup, and marketplace shares. Since the script uses a current univention samba4 version, it must first be updated to version UCS 4.4-5 errata789 (Bug #42182).
