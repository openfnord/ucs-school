desc: |
 * Insufficient LDAP permissions and an typo within the LDAP ACLs prevented teachers from resetting student
   passwords if the student is located underneath another school OU. This problem has been fixed (Bug #47625).
 * Added new beta feature to enable educational school slaves to replicate also UCS@school staff user objects.
   This feature can be activated via the UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/ldap/replicate_staff_to_edu</envar>.
   Please activate this feature only if you know all side effects and necessary steps (Bug #48068).
