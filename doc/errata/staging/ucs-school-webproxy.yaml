 * The UCR variable <literal>proxy/pac/exclude/domains/domainnames</literal> is not supported anymore. The UCR variable <literal>proxy/pac/exclude/domains/dnsnames</literal> must be used instead. An automatic migration will be tried. If both variables exist, the migration must be done manually (Bug #47645).
