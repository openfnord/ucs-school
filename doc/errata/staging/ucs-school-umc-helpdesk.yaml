desc: |
 * Importing model classes from the Python package <tt>ucsschool.lib.models</tt> has been deprecated for UCS@school 5.0. The packages <tt>__init__.py</tt> file does not import all classes from its submodules anymore. From UCS@school 5.0 on, the classes must be imported directly. For example <tt>from ucsschool.lib.models import Student</tt> must now be written as <tt>from ucsschool.lib.models.user import Student</tt>. This patch updates the code in 4.4, so it will run unchanged in 5.0  (Bug #52945).
