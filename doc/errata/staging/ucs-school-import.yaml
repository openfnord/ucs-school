 * A new import hook was added to set sambahome, profilepath, homedrive & scriptpath for staff members. Without it, those values will be empty for staff users. The values are set to the same values as those of the teachers (Bug #51724).
 * The "ucsschool_role" property of all "Marktplatz" shares is now set to "marketplace_share:school:$OU" (Bug #51301).
