 * A configuration key <literal>csv:allowed_missing_columns</literal> was added. It can be assigned a list of column names that are allowed to be missing in the input data (Bug #48655).
 * A hook was added that runs before reading the input data (Bug #48188).
 * An example pre-read hook was added, that can change the column names in a CSV file (Bug #48189).
