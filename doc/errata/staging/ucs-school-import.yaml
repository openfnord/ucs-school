desc: |
 * The UCS@school import frameworks ImportUser class has been made more accessable to 3rd party software (Bug #48423).
 * The UCS@school import is now forward compatible to the renaming of record_uid and source_uid in UCS@school 4.4v1 (Bug #48478).
 * An OID collision in the UCS@school schema has been fixed. This is just a precaution. Problems are not known at this time (Bug #45538).
