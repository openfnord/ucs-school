 * User property verification checks are executed in dry-run again (Bug #46572).
 * New UCS@school objects are now marked with a unique object class and attribute. A script can be used to mark all existing objects: <filename>/usr/share/ucs-school-import/scripts/migrate_ucsschool_object_types</filename> (Bug #45379).
 * User property verification checks are executed in dry-run again (Bug #46572).
 * A dependency solver was introduced, that will sort the order of autogeneration of attributes from schemes so that they can depend on each other (Bug #42137).
 * The command line user import now stores the summary and new-user password CSV files in separate folders (<filename class="directory">/var/lib/ucs-school-import/summary</filename> and <filename class="directory">/var/lib/ucs-school-import/passwords</filename>). Password CSV files are now generated by default (Bug #46799).
