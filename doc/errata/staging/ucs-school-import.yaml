 * User property verification checks are executed in dry-run again (Bug #46572).
 * New UCS@school objects are now marked with a unique object class and attribute. A script can be used to mark all existing objects: <filename>/usr/share/ucs-school-import/scripts/migrate_ucsschool_object_types</filename>. After running the script for all existing objects and schools, a listener module must be activated: "ucr set listener/module/ucsschool_admin_object_type/deactivate=no; service univention-directory-listener restart" (Bug #45379).
 * User property verification checks are executed in dry-run again (Bug #46572).
 * A dependency solver was introduced, that will sort the order of autogeneration of attributes from schemes so that they can depend on each other (Bug #42137).
