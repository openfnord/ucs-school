desc: |
 * The UCS@school import frameworks ImportUser class has been made more accessable to 3rd party software (Bug #48423).
 * Activate the role feature by default (Bug #48226).
 * Change default of normalize:firstname and normalize:lastname to false (Bug #47351).
 * To be more consistent with other variable names, recordUID and sourceUID have been renamed to record_uid and source_uid (Bug #48478)
 * A users school_classes are now removed, if its entry in the school_classes column is empty (Bug #48045).
 * Activate substring search for ucs@school roles (Bug #48246).
 * An OID collision in the UCS@school schema has been fixed. This is just a precaution. Problems are not known at this time (Bug #45538).
 * The old legacy import now sets options, ucsschool_roles and schools (Bug #48678).
 * The postinst scripts now use <command>call_joinscript</command> instead of calling join scripts directly (Bug #48731).
 * Specify description of <envar>ucsschool/import/attach/policy/default-umc-users</envar> (Bug #48722).
 * Starting with UCS@school 4.4, it is no longer supported to create secondary slaves for a school server. Therefore the script <filename>ucs-school-join-secondary-samba4</filename> has been removed (Bug #48836).
