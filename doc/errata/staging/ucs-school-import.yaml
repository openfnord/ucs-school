 * A script (fix_ucsschool_slaves) has been added that automatically fixes broken domaincontroller slave object.
   This script is automatically by the join script of the package <packagename>ucs-school-import</packagename>.
   To prevent the automatic correction, set the UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/update/skip-slave-object-correction=true</envar> (Bug #50116).
