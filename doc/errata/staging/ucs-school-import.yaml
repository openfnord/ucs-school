desc: |
 * A script (fix_ucsschool_slaves) has been added that automatically fixes broken domaincontroller slave object.
   This script is started automatically by the join script of the package <packagename>ucs-school-import</packagename>.
   To prevent the automatic correction, set the UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/update/skip-slave-object-correction=true</envar> before updating.
   All checks and changes are recorded in the log file <filename>/var/log/univention/ucsschool-fix-slave-objects.log</filename>(Bug #50116).
