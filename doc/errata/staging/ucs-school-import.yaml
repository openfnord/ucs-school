 * The UCS@school import framework's <literal>ImportUser</literal> class has been made more accessible to 3rd party software (Bug #48423).
 * The UCS@school import is now forward compatible to the renaming of <literal>record_uid</literal> and <literal>source_uid</literal> in UCS@school 4.4v1 (Bug #48478).
 * The description of the UCR variable <envar>ucsschool/import/attach/policy/default-umc-users</envar> has been clarified (Bug #48722).
 * The <literal>ucsschoolRole</literal> migration script was fixed to not use lower case OU names on DC computer objects (Bug #48792).
 * An OID collision in the UCS@school LDAP schema has been fixed. This is just a precaution. Problems are not known at this time (Bug #45538).
