 * The UMC import module now shows a summary after a successful dry-run (Bug #46712).
 * Internal change: a new exception type has been introduced, to skip single import users on non-fatal errors (Bug #47162).
 * Internal change: a new PyHook <literal>PostReadPyHook</literal> has been introduced, which is executed after reading each individual data record and can also change it (Bug #47221).
 * Internal change: a new PyHook <literal>ResultPyHook</literal> has been introduced, which is executed after the import has finished (Bug #47302).

 * The CSV import via ucs-school-user-import is now able to handle UTF-8 files with byte order mark (UTF-8 BOM) correctly. In the past the BOM was interpreted as user data (Bug #47305).

 * An interface for adding custom configuration checks has been added (Bug #47448).
 * A user is not moved to another school, when that school is imported to be an additional school for the user and the schools name is alphanumerically sorted earlier that the school the user is already a member of (Bug #47450).
 * Don't create roles in import when feature is deactivated (Bug #47451).
