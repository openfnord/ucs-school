 * The import now also checks the most common errors in dry-runs (Bug #46837).
 * The UMC import module now shows a summary after a successful dry-run (Bug #46838).
 * In dry run, a read-only cn=admin LDAP connection is used (Bug #47204).
 * File permissions are now set correctly on initial installations of the HTTP-API import (Bug #47472).
 * The HTTP API used a single user (<literal>importhttpapi</literal>) on all systems where the HTTP API is installed. This led to some authentication problems. Therefore, a different account for authentication is now created on each DC backup (Bug #47682).
