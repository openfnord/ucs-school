 * The global user import configuration (<filename>user_import_defaults.json</filename>) does not contain any scheme anymore. Its existence was preventing the creation of users without email address (Bug #45972).
 * An internal improvement has been made to give python hooks more flexibility: if available, the responsible line of the CSV file is now attached to an ImportUser object that is about to be deleted (Bug #46384).
