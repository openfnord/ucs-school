fix: 17.0.33A~4.4.0.202004291659
desc: |
  * When ucsschool/import/generate/user/attributes/no-overwrite-by-schema was an empty string, the import would not recognize it as unset and assume all attributes should be overwritten - including uid and mailPrimaryAddress. This fix ensures that uid and mailPrimaryAddress will not be overwritten in that case.

  * Schemes in user import configuration now get checked for valid format (correct usage of symbols '<', '>', '[' and ']')
