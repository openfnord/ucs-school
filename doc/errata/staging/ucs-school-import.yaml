desc: |
 * When modifying an existing user, the attribute of the old user object in "ImportUser.old_user" were incorrectly updated. This has been fixed (Bug #47028).
 * New user role assignment can now be handled by the regular CSV reader class. This allows the use of the special mapping value <literal>__role</literal>. Allowed values in the CSV column are <literal>student</literal>, <literal>staff</literal>, <literal>teacher</literal> and <literal>teacher_and_staff</literal> (Bug #47073).
 * Leading and trailing whitespace in CSV cells is now removed. Access to the unmodified data (including the whitespace is still possible through the <literal>input_data</literal> attribute of <classname>ImportUser</classname> objects (Bug #47092).
 * Increase Celery worker startup verbosity, adapt HTTP-API import code to handle newer Django versions (Bug #47118).
