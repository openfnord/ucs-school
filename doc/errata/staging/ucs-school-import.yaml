fix: 17.0.35A~4.4.0.202005051459
desc: |
  * When ucsschool/import/generate/user/attributes/no-overwrite-by-schema was an empty string, the import would not recognize it as unset and assume all attributes should be overwritten - including uid and mailPrimaryAddress. This fix ensures that uid and mailPrimaryAddress will not be overwritten in that case (Bug #51003).
  * Schemes in user import configurations now get checked for valid format (correct usage of symbols <envar>\<, \>, [ and ]</envar>) (Bug #50894).
bug: [51003, 50894]
