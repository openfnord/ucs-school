desc: |
 * It is now possible to enforce the override behavior for <envar>dhcpd/ldap/base</envar> during school creation (Bug #48469).
 * Additional special characters in usernames can now be configured through the configuration key username:allowed_special_chars. The default is backwards compatible and contains only the dot. Only dash and underscore can also be used (resulting in the configuration value ".-_") (Bug #49260).
