 * A new import hook was added to set sambahome, profilepath, homedrive and scriptpath for staff members. Without it, those values will be empty for staff users. The values are set to the same values as those of the teachers (Bug #51724).
 * The <literal>ucsschool_role</literal> property of all <emphasis>Marktplatz</emphasis> shares is now set to <literal>marketplace_share:school:$OU</literal> (Bug #51301).
