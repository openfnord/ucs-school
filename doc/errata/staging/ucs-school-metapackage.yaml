desc: |
 * When joining a Domaincontroller Backup into a UCS@school domain, demo schools are no longer created. The creation of demo schools is only performed during initial installation of UCS@school on the Domaincontroller Master (Bug #50578).
 * To reduce the load of LDAP servers in the UCS@school domain, the UCR variable <envar>nss/group/cachefile/check_member</envar> will be unset during the update to UCS@school 4.4v5 or higher. Thus the ldap-group-to-file mechanism no longer checks each group member for existence (Bug #50905).
