 * During a re-join of DC school slaves, the LDAP attribute <literal>userAccountControl</literal> was set to demote these objects,
   which caused them to be recognized as normal Windows Host Objects by the S4 Connector.
   The S4 Connector then mistakenly appended the value <literal>win_computer</literal> to the LDAP attribute <literal>ucsschoolRole</literal>.
   This faulty behaviour has been fixed (Bug #50280).
