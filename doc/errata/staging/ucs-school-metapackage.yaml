desc: |
 * When joining a backup onto a master, on which the UCRV ucsschool/join/create_demo has been set to 'no', no demoschool is created as expected (Bug #50578).
 * To reduce the load on ldap servers in the domain the config registry value <envar>nss/group/cachefile/check_member</envar> has been unset. Which means the default behaviour has changed and group members are not checked for existence (Bug #50905).
