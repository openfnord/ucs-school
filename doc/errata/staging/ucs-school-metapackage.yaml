 * UCS@school version 4.4 v7 requires UCS to be updated to at least <emphasis>4.4-6 errata762</emphasis>. On the DVD installation media that is not the case, and thus the installation of new systems fails when the pre-join hook tries to install <emphasis>UCS@school 4.4 v7</emphasis>. The pre-join hook has been modified to detect that situation and install <emphasis>UCS@school version 4.4 v6</emphasis> instead. The user can update to <emphasis>4.4 v7</emphasis> after the installation finishes (Bug #52214).
