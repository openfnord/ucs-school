desc: |
 * On servers with the role of DC master in single server environments or DC slaves, the script <code>set_nt_acl_on_shares</code> is executed during the joinscript. Permissions are set so that students can no longer change folder permissions or take over class, workgroup, and marketplace shares. A current <package>univention-samba4<package> package version is required, so UCS must first be updated to version "4.4-5 errata746" (Bug #42182).
 * Disable the synchronization of msgpipsec and msgpsi AD objects to avoid rejects that occured after the release of ucs-school-metapackage in version 12.0.3-3 with Bug 50626 (Bug #52049).
