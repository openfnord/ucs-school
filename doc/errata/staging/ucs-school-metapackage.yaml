desc: |
 * When updating on a DC master (Primary node) in a single server environments or on school servers (DC slaves / Replicatiopn node), the script <command>set_nt_acl_on_shares</command> is executed during the joinscript. Permissions are set so that students can no longer change folder permissions or take over class, workgroup, and marketplace shares. A current <package>univention-samba4<package> package version is required, so UCS must first be updated to version "4.4-5 errata746" or higher (Bug #42182).
 * The synchronization of <code>msgpipsec</code> and <code>msgpsi</code> AD objects has been disabled to avoid rejects that occured after the release of ucs-school-metapackage in version 12.0.3-3 with Bug 50626 (Bug #52049).
