 * Until now, wake-on-LAN packets were only sent out via an external tool via the network interface to which the
   default route was assigned. The UMC module <package>computerroom</package> now creates these packages itself
   and sends them by default on <emphasis>all<emphasis> interfaces unless the interface is on a blacklist (see UCR variables
   <envar>ucsschool/umc/computerroom/wakeonlan/blacklisted/interfaces</envar> and
   <envar>ucsschool/umc/computerroom/wakeonlan/blacklisted/interface_prefixes</envar>) (Bug #49970).
