 * Instead of showing an empty list of computer rooms there is now a dialog asking if the user wants to create one. The dialog is only shown if the user is authorized to create a room and the module manages only a single school (Bug #43080).
 * The free printing option within the computer room settings has been removed. Samba does no longer support the required feature to provide this option in UCS@school (Bug #35076).
 * The description text for the file share restriction options in the settings dialog has been renamed to improve usability (Bug #43037).
