 * In version 4.4 v8 we introduced a feature, which allowed the usage of clients with multiple IP addresses. This can lead to long waiting times if computers inside a computer room are not running. The feature is now disabled by default and can be activated by setting the UCR-V <envar>ucsschool/umc/computerroom/ping-client-ip-addresses</envar> (Bug #52425).
